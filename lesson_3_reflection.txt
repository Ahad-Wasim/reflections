Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Response:
- You would generally want to use a remote repository if you want to share your code to your friends or to just leave it for the whole open source community to view. Pushing your code onto the remote repository makes it possible for others ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD to view your code because it is hassle free. Everything is displayed online in a easy to read format. 
- Having the whole open source community viewing your code can be extremely useful not only to you, but to a lot of developers out their as well. They could either learn from your code or add some changes to it to make it more efficient.
- Another reason on why having your code stored on a remote repository can be super helpful is because you can lose all your files on your working directory and their may be know way to recovering them back. Well if you have a working version of your project online, then you can easily retreive it back just by typing git clone.


Question 2:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Response:
Well in order to collaborate effectively on a project you have to share a repo with your group. That repo's master branch will continue to change throughout your whole project. So in order to work on the latest repo's over and over agiain you will need to pull them from the remote repo.

Question 3:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Response:
Forks - Copying another contributors repo and pasting that repo on your profile. By doing this you give credit to the original creator. And with that copy you have on your repo you can push directly to that repo(Not the original creator of that repo). The origin when you clone the repo to your computer is set to the remote URL of that copied repo on your profile.

Clone - Simply copies the entire repo including its commit history(git log). Origin is set to the contributors origin.

Branches - You can choose which branch to clone. Generally the master branch has all the useful features that you may want to use so the master branch is usually what you clone and push.
